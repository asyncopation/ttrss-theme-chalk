================= 

** For Legacy Versions **

Sometimes the TT-RSS maintainer makes changes that break theme compatability.  Use the following tags if you're still using an old version of ttrss.

* ttrss version 1.8-1.11 use tag "ttrss-v1.8"
* ttrss version 1.12-1.15.2 use tag "ttrss-v1.12"

---------------------

A simplistic theme for the tt-rss reader based off of the work by [levito](https://github.com/levito/tt-rss-feedly-theme).
